            <p>There have been lots of awesome works around the topic of bimanual teleoperation and learning
                from demonstration, employing various human sensing systems and robot embodiments. To name a

            <p>However, researchers design and evaluate on tasks that they come up with and perform
                teleoperation themselves. Also, there are lots of metrics that are critical for industry that

            <p>Therefore, there has been a demand in the industry to set up a common set of tasks benchmark that
                is practically valuable and reflects various axes and levels of difficulty. The goal of this
                competition is to bring together researchers with industry and figure out the best fits between
                valuable tasks and technology solutions.</p>

            <p>In this competition, participants are invited to use a wide range of ways: puppeteering, VR,

                perform challenging and practically valuable manipulation tasks and collect data meanwhile. We
                will evaluate the teams in terms of their task completion quality, data collection speed, and

                Teams are require using teleoperation to accomplish challenging dexterous tasks that require
                two arms to accomplish, which is a highlight difference of this competition versus others. The tasks
                were designed and adapted to be suitable for competition by sponsors with extensive practice experience
                in the field, some are the key technical challenges to their businesses, each of which has on the order
                of billions of USD scale Total Addressable Market (TAM). On the technical side, academic organizers
                intentionally include the open research challenges, such as manipulating articulated (paper box),
                fragile (test tube) and soft objects (linen), dynamic/moving objects (on conveyer), etc.</p>

                    plastic material box as packing bin, the advanced version uses cardboard box as packing bin, and
                    the advanced version requires robot to close the cardboard box after placing 10 goods</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Installing a Silica Gel Column:</strong>
                    <p>The robot retrieves a silica gel column from a designated storage area and installs it on a
                        column chromatography device. The column uses a Luer lock connection, requiring the robot to
                        precisely align and tighten the connection to ensure a secure and sealed fit.</p>

                            The tightened column must then be placed onto a fixed rack (a model of which will be
                            provided later).

                        <li>
                            The robot must neatly arrange the randomly placed glass sample tubes from the basket
                            onto Rack A.

                <li><strong>Selecting and Pouring Sample Tubes:</strong>
                    <p>After the rack is filled, the referee provides a diagram specifying which sample tubes to
                        retrieve. The robot must accurately identify and select the specified tubes based on the
                        diagram, place them into Rack B, and pour the liquid from the remaining tubes into a waste
                        container without spilling.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The robot must accurately select and retrieve the specified sample tubes from Rack A,

                The teams are responsible for transporting their teleop sensing system to Atlanta, they can transport
                their robot, too, if they want to leverage advanced features like force sensing, but since transporting
                robots is expensive, we have three hardware sponsors, AgileX, ARX, and Galaxea who will provide and
                transport their robot hardware for the competition.
            </p>
            <p> For those teams who would like to use exoskeleton, hand-held grippers, movement-tracking gloves, or
                algorithmic human hand sensing for data collection, they are responsible for projecting their data to
                the action space of the sponsor robot, or their own robot if they transport their robot to Atlanta.
            </p>
            <p>Depending on the funding to be raised, we may hire human operators to help collect data and judge the
                task completion qualities.</p>
